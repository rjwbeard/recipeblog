        I'm Rebecca and I really love to feed people. I think recipes are best
        treated as guidelines and that food is the best way to bring people
        together. So experiment, make some substitutions, and invite a few
        friends over! With a couple of clicks you can log in to the Cookie
        Worldwide community and gain access to both the comment section and the
        soon-to-come Add A Recipe feature, where users can share their own
        kitchen creations. Thank you for hanging out here with me, I hope you
        come back soon!
